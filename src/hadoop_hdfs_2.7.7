dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.enable                              # If there is a datanode/network failure in the write pipeline, DFSClient will try to remove the failed datanode from the pipeline and then continue writing with the remaining datanodes. As a result, the number of datanodes in the pipeline is decreased. The feature is to add new datanodes to the pipeline. This is a site-wide property to enable/disable the feature. When the cluster size is extremely small, e.g. 3 nodes or less, cluster administrators may want to set the policy to NEVER in the default configuration file or disable this feature. Otherwise, users may experience an unusually high rate of pipeline failures since it is impossible to find new datanodes for replacement.

Best effort means that the client will try to replace a failed datanode in write pipeline (provided that the policy is satisfied), however, it continues the write operation in case that the datanode replacement also fails. Suppose the datanode replacement fails. false: An exception should be thrown so that the write will fail. true : The write should be resumed with the remaining datandoes. Note that setting this property to true allows writing to a pipeline with a smaller number of datanodes. As a result, it increases the probability of data loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                # FALSE

The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being limited to 100ms, not 25ms. Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%. Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result in the throttle being disbled and an error message being logged. 1000 is the default setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            # 0

It does not translate directly to file's age, or the number of files kept, but to the number of transactions (here "edits" means transactions). One edit file may contain several transactions (edits). During checkpoint, NameNode will identify the total number of edits to retain as extra by checking the latest checkpoint transaction value, subtracted by the value of this property. Then, it scans edits files to identify the older ones that don't include the computed range of retained transactions that are to be kept around, and purges them subsequently. The retainment can be useful for audit purposes or for an HA setup where a remote Standby Node may have been offline for some time and need to have a longer backlog of retained edits in order to start again. Typically each edit is on the order of a few hundred bytes, so the default of 1 million edits should be on the order of hundreds of MBs or low GBs. NOTE: Fewer extra edits may be retained than value specified for this setting if doing so would mean that more segments would be retained than the number configured by dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained. # 1000000

This determines the percentage amount of block invalidations (deletes) to do over a single DN heartbeat deletion command. The final deletion count is determined by applying this percentage to the number of live nodes in the system. The resultant number is the number of blocks from the deletion list chosen for proper invalidation over a single heartbeat of a single DN. Value should be a positive, non-zero percentage in float notation (X.Yf), with 1.0f meaning 100%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    # 0.32f
dfs.namenode.replication.work.multiplier.per.iteration                                 # *Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution. This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in parallel at a DN, for replication, when such a command list is being sent over a DN heartbeat by the NN. The actual number is obtained by multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers immediately for, per DN heartbeat. This number can be any positive, non-zero integer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            # 2

Note that the behavior of the "rws" flags is platform and hardware specific and might not provide the same level of guarantees as FileChannel # force. For example, the write will skip the disk-cache on SAS and SCSI devices while it might not on SATA devices. This is an expert level setting, change with caution. # FALSE

This behavior is intended as a failsafe for when the standby or secondary namenode fail to roll the edit log by the normal checkpoint threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               # 2.0

Thus it may be unwanted behavior to allow datanode registration with the default rack if the resolving topology failed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              # FALSE
