This is useful when invalid users are retrying frequently. It is suggested to set a small value for this expiration, since a transient error in group lookup could temporarily lock out a legitimate user. Set this to zero or negative value to disable negative user-to-group caching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                # 30

In order to authentiation to work correctly across all Hadoop nodes web-consoles the domain must be correctly set. IMPORTANT: when using IP addresses, browsers ignore cookies with domain settings. For this setting to work properly all nodes in the cluster must be configured to generate URLs with hostname.domain names on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  #

These are specified in the same format as used by the "addauth" command in the ZK CLI. It is important that the authentications specified here are sufficient to access znodes with the ACL specified in ha.zookeeper.acl. If the auths contain secrets, you may instead specify a path to a file, prefixed with the '@' symbol, and the value of this configuration will be loaded from within.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          #

If jceks.key.serialFilter is not configured it will cause an error when recovering keystore file in KeyProviderFactory when recovering key from keystore file using JDK 8u171 or newer. The filter pattern uses the same format as jdk.serialFilter. The value of this property will be used as the following: 1. The value of jceks.key.serialFilter system property takes precedence over the value of this property. 2. In the absence of jceks.key.serialFilter system property the value of this property will be set as the value of jceks.key.serialFilter. 3. If the value of this property and jceks.key.serialFilter system property has not been set, org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.KeyProvider sets a default value for jceks.key.serialFilter. #
